Hostel Management System
Rationale: 
There are a lot of people who come to cities leaving their family and comfort 
zones behind. In these new cities they need a place to live and the search for a 
reliable as well as comfortable and economic begins. Finding such a place in a 
new city about which you know nothing is a tough job. With our website we are 
making this job just a bit easier with the multiple user friendly methods and 
features we are providing both at the hostel and the website which will make 
the residents carefree about any kinds of cheatings or anything wrong. 
Problem Definition: 
Problem definition is to provide a centralized management system to meet the 
entire requirement of the hostel for the residents. 
A hostel is an accommodation or lodging for the students. In College mess
facility is also provided for the students. Thus maintaining the hostel and mess 
manually can prove to be very tedious process, since it often includes huge 
databases like students account number and details, list, mess details. Since 
these tasks are repetitive in nature like searching, sorting, selecting etc., so it is 
highly efficient to go in for the computerization of this process. 
1. Admin control 
2. Front Desk 
3. Complaint submission 
Proposed Solution: 
The hostel management system will help to resolve the issues like bills’ 
management and splitting it for all the residents, the availability of rooms in the 
hostel, rent payment status, the contact details and permanent addresses of the 
residents. This website being an interactive one, the users will be using their 
specific mail IDs and passwords using which they will be able to update the 
required data and information needed to keep the hostel’s site up to date which 
will further lead to better working and management of the hostel.
